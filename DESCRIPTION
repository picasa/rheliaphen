Title: Tools for phenotyping and modeling with the Heliaphen sunflower
    phenotyping platform
Description: A set of tools for working with the Heliaphen phenotyping platform
    to (1) estimate water deficit, leaf and plant area from raw datasets, (2)
    compute complex traits (leaf expansion rate, plant transpiration rate, plant
    senescence rate) from phenotyped data and (3) model the trait response to
    soil and climatic water deficit.
