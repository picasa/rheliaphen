Title: Tools for phenotyping and modeling with the Heliaphen sunflower
    phenotyping platform.
Description: A set of tools for working with the Heliaphen phenotyping platform
    to (1) estimate water deficit, leaf and plant area from raw datasets, (2)
    compute complex traits (leaf expansion rate, plant transpiration rate, plant
    senescence rate) from phenotyped data and (3) model the response of complex
    traits to soil and climatic water deficit.
